###Based on the Given specifications, this project implements a 1D-stencil operation on a vector using:
- C (Baseline Implementation)
- CUDA C program using Colab platform
## About the project
This project implements the Hadamard product (element-wise multiplication of two matrices) using both CPU and GPU approaches. The focus is on analyzing different CUDA memory management techniques and their impact on execution time and memory transfer efficiency.
##Objectives
1. Implement the Hadamard product in C (CPU implementation) and CUDA (GPU implementation).
2. Measure and compare execution time and memory transfer overhead.
## Results and Discussion:
### A.) Execution time comparison between C And CUDA Colab Platform
